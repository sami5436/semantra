# Semantra: Semantic Web Search for Microsoft Edge

**Semantra** is an intelligent Microsoft Edge extension that helps users search, understand, and summarize the content of any webpage using natural language. Instead of relying on simple keyword matching, Semantra understands meaning, context, and relevance—bringing the power of AI directly into your browser.

## What Makes It Different

Traditional browser search tools only highlight exact words or phrases. Semantra takes it a step further by using semantic understanding. You can ask questions in plain English, and it will search the **meaning** of the content—not just the exact words.

Whether you're reviewing long articles, technical documents, or legal pages, Semantra helps you find what matters, faster.

## How It Works (High-Level Overview)

When you ask a question through the Semantra sidebar or popup interface:

1. **Webpage Processing**
   The extension first extracts all visible content from the webpage you're viewing. This is done in real-time and focuses only on what a human would see (ignoring HTML tags, ads, and hidden elements).

2. **Semantic Understanding**
   The content is then broken down into smaller sections. Each section is converted into a numerical format using AI language models. These representations capture the meaning of the text, not just the words.

3. **Smart Matching**
   Your question is also transformed in the same way. Then, Semantra compares it against the content of the page to find the most relevant sections based on meaning. Even if your question uses different words than the page, the system can still find the answer.

4. **Accuracy Check**
   To avoid false matches, the system uses a locally running AI model to evaluate whether the selected results are actually relevant. It can even explain why something might be off-topic.

5. **Query Refinement (Optional)**
   If the initial results don’t seem helpful, the system automatically rewrites or clarifies the question in a smarter way and tries again—just like a human would when rephrasing a search.

6. **Answer Summarization**
   Once the best matching sections are found and verified, the AI condenses the information into a clear, easy-to-read answer and highlights the relevant parts on the page.

## Why It Matters

Semantra makes web browsing more productive and less frustrating. Instead of scanning pages for keywords, users can ask real questions and get answers instantly. This is especially useful for:

* Students analyzing long articles or papers
* Professionals reviewing legal or technical content
* Researchers looking for specific details in dense reports
* Anyone trying to make sense of complex online information

---

## Future Vision

Semantra aims to redefine how we interact with information on the internet. Planned features include:

* Highlighting results directly on the page
* Saving and exporting summarized notes
* Supporting multilingual search
* Integrating with research tools and databases

## Summary

Semantra bridges the gap between search and understanding. By using AI to interpret your questions and the webpage content itself, it turns any website into a source of quick, meaningful answers—right inside your browser.
